h1. Modest dotfiles

Used to sync some command-line settings across machines or as a place for my BBEdit scripts.

Other than that, mostly using IntelliJ anyway.

Note to self: Don't forget

* @set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths /usr/local/bin@
* @set -xU PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig@

h2. Package Installation

Some notes on compiling specific packages on OS X 10.9:

* pkg-config:  @./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/pkg-config --with-internal-glib@
* glib: @./configure --prefix /usr/local/stow/glib --with-pcre=internal@
* ImageMagick: To get PNG support, install @libpng@ *and* @libjpeg@ first!
